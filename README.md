# What Are Skills and Practices?
As described by the introductory article, Skills and Practices are the foundation of teamwork. Skills are abilities. Practices are beliefs and behaviors that teams and individuals hold. Skills require knowledge, and practices require collaboration. Together, skills and practices relate to everything else that goes on in product and service delivery: activities, deliverables, project outcomes, and more. These pieces of data are the molecules upon which teamwork builds.

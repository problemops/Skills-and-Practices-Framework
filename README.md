# What Are Skills and Practices?

## Description
Skills and Practices are the foundation of teamwork. Skills are both technical and interpresonal abilities. Practices are beliefs and behaviors that teams and individuals hold. Skills require knowledge, and practices require collaboration. Teams must share common values, common beliefs, and common behavior before they can perform together. Skills are secondary to practices. Together, skills and practices affect everything else that goes on in product and service delivery: activities, team roles, deliverables, project outcomes, and more. Skills and practices are the molecules upon which teamwork builds.
